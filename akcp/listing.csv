When set to Low the pin will output 0 volts. When set as a High the pin will output 5 volts. When used as an input a switch will retain any error condition until it is read via SNMP. Therefore if a switch encounters a critical condition at any time it must report that condition before it can return to a normal state. Input pins can be used to detect whether or not an input switch is open or closed. In combination with external sensors, input pins can detect whether a door or window is open or closed, if there is a water incursion and many other conditions. ;N/A;https://www.akcp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/single-dry-contact-sensor.png

Much of the time this can be attributed to insuficient fuel. Fuel theft is also a problem for many generators, particularly those at remote site locations which are difficult to monitor and secure. Tank Depth Pressure Sensors can be deployed to tackle many of these comon issues. Monitor fuel level and know when to schedule refilling of the tanks Monitoring of fuel level for sudden drops that could indicate leakage or theft Graphing and record of fuel usage over time Compare fuel usage with fuel delivery billing. Conect to a single sensor port on your sensorProbe+, securityProbe+ or securityprobe base unit. Alerts can be sent through SNMP, E-mail and SMS (with optional cellular data modem). Remote site locations can be monitored from our central monitoring software AKCPro Server, which includes drill down mapping and customizable desktops to display the data you need. sensorProbe+, securityProbe+ and securityProbe devices are Modbus ready, making connection with many generator control panels easy via their Modbus RS485 output. Combined with an Ultrasonic Fuel Level Sensor it gives you a complete remote site generator monitoring solution. Fuel Theft Typical fuel theft is done by inside personel and amounts to just a few litres per day. In a case of one of our African customers 10 litres per day was being skimmed from the tank. Typically this would not be easily detected with fuel level monitoring only. However, witht eh addition of a Modbus connection to the geenrator, it is possible to have a monthly report of total fuel used by the generator and compare this to total fuel used from the tank as read by the TDPS. In this case, 10 litres per day equated to 300 litres per month. The generator flow meter stated 400 litres was consumed, the TDPS showed a drop of 680 litres, showing an obvious large difference in the actual fuel used and the fuel remaining in the tank. ;N/A;https://www.akcp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tank-depth-pressure-sensor.jpg
